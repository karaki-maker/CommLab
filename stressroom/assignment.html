      <h2>Project 1: Shanzhai Web</h2>
      <p class="lede">Shanzhai Â±±ÂØ®, literally meaning ‚Äúmountain fortress,‚Äù originally described bandits (in the mountains) who opposed and evaded corrupt authorities during the Song dynasty. Today, shanzhai refers to counterfeit goods that rebel against the established commercial market, carrying a spirit of opposition and individuality. Some shanzhai products aim to deceive buyers, others add missing features, and many are made in jest or parody.

      <h2>5.R Anatomy of a Website</h2>
      <p class="lede">This exercise is in the service of Project 1 - Shanzhai Web. Working on it directly contributes to your midterm project.

        Before you can remix a website, you must understand how it‚Äôs built: visually and structurally.

        In this exercise, you will take apart an existing website to study its anatomy: how it organizes information, directs attention, and creates a specific feel through visual design and layout.</p>
